# Known Issues

For the time being I will be keeping track of known issues here for future reference.  This may end up being moved elsewhere such as to the issues tab at a later date.

* Plain React state (without Redux) is not currently prerendered on the server.  This causes a few graphical issues such as brief flashes of gray prior to images rendering in the image slider, or social media links not being immediatelly loaded onto the screen.
* The About page's about text section does not properly format submitted text such as with new line generation to form separate paragraphs.

Issues will continue to be added to the list as they become known.

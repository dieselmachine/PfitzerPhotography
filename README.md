Pfitzer Photography is a full-stack web application for displaying and advertising one's photography as a portfolio.  It is divided into two sections: the public-facing website itself and the admin site accessible with admin credentials for CMS purposes.

The site uses both JavaScript and Python as a complete full-stack CMS solution.  React is used on the frontend to build out the UI, featuring SPA routing and asynchronous JavaScript for data fetching.  Django works most of the backend, providing the admin site that powers a variety of content management tools.  Server-side rendering is also implemented using a seperate Node.js process with Express to serve up the app with pre-loaded data.  A MySQL database is provisioned for content storage.

## Implementation

Design decisions and code implementation will be added shortly.

**Formal website and code documentation coming soon!**

As development gets under way, further documentation on the inner workings of the website including website management, code navigation, and design decisions will be added to the README and [the repository's wiki](https://github.com/Xoadra/PfitzerPhotography/wiki).


For now though, enjoy!
